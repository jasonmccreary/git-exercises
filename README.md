# Git Exercise
This exercise helps practice the basic Git commands for manage changes within a respository, including: `add`, `commit`, `log`, `rm`, `reset`, `checkout`, and `revert`.

For this exercise, create a repository which stores a text file with the [10-day Weather Forecast](https://weather.com/tenday) for your local area. While completing this exercise, log each of your Git commands for review at the end of the exercise.

To exercise each of the Git commands, complete the following steps. **Don't forget to track each Git command you run** in the `command.log`.

1. Create a new Git repository called _weather-forecast_.
2. Create a `command.log` file for tracking the Git commands.
3. Add the `command.log` to the repository with the latest commands.
4. Commit your changes.
5. Create a `forecast.txt` file with the dates for the next **7 days** on a line.
6. Commit your changes (don't forget to update the `command.log`)
7. Update the forecast for the **first day** tracking the _high_ and _low_ by appending it to the proper date line.
8. Commit your changes.
9. Update the forecast for the **third day** tracking the _high_ and _low_ by appending it to the proper date line.
10. Commit your changes.
11. Update the forecast for the **fifth day** tracking the _high_ and _low_ by appending it to the proper date line.
12. Update the forecast for the **second, fourth, sixth, and seventh day** tracking the _high_ and _low_ by appending it to the proper date line.
13. Commit the forecast for each day **as a separate commit**.
14. Update the forecast with the **last 3 days** of the 10-day forecast.
15. Commit your changes.
16. Undo the changes in the last commit.
17. Update the forecast with the **last 2 days** as a separate commit.
18. Update the forecast with the **eight day** as a separate commit.
19. Undo the forecast for the **seventh day**.
